To create the `HelloWorld.java` file using the Linux terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open your Terminal**: You can usually find the terminal in your applications menu, or you can use a keyboard shortcut like `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

2. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory**: Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you want to create the file. For example, to navigate to the Documents folder, you can run:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents
   ```

3. **Create the Java File**: Use a text editor like `nano` or `vim` to create and edit the file. Here’s how to do it with `nano`:
   ```bash
   nano HelloWorld.java
   ```

4. **Copy and Paste the Code**: Once you’re in the `nano` editor, paste the following code:

   ```java
   public class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Save the File**:
   - In `nano`, press `Ctrl + O` to write the changes to the file, then press `Enter` to confirm.
   - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

6. **Compile and Run the Program**:
   - To compile the program, run:
     ```bash
     javac HelloWorld.java
     ```
   - To run the program, use:
     ```bash
     java HelloWorld
     ```

You should see the output:
```
Hello, World!
```
